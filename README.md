# Demo, deployment of node.js server

This app is hosted on Heroku, you can see it live [here](https://hidden-shelf-52579.herokuapp.com/).

## Motivation

I was interested in deployment node.js servers.

Along the way I found out about following topics:

- Deployment setup and required configuration.
- Monitoring deployment status.
- Reading build logs.
- Setting up deployment rules.

## Now supports React

I added React CDN scripts to see how does it play along with Pug template engine.
